   Q1.What is the difference between Compiler and Interpreter.

     Answer:- A compiler translates the entire source code into an executable file before running it, 
                    while an interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.
     The compiler produces optimized code and error messages upfront, resulting in faster execution but longer initial processing time.
  In contrast, an interpreter provides immediate feedback and detects errors as it encounters them but may sacrifice some performance              optimizations.

  Q2.What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
   

  1. JDK (Java Development Kit):

 The JDK is a software development package that provides tools, libraries, and executables necessary for developing Java applications.
It includes the Java compiler (javac) for compiling Java source code into bytecode, as well as other development tools like debugger (jdb) and documentation generator (javadoc).
The JDK also contains libraries and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that developers can use to build Java applications.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment):

 2.  The JRE is an environment that allows you to run Java applications on your computer or server.
It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), core libraries, and other dependencies required to execute Java programs.
The JRE does not include development tools like the compiler or debugger, so it is primarily used by end-users who only need to run Java applications.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

 3. The JVM is the runtime environment in which Java bytecode is executed.
It is responsible for interpreting or just-in-time compiling the bytecode and executing it on the underlying hardware and operating system.
The JVM provides platform independence, allowing Java programs to run on any system that has a compatible JVM installed.
It also manages memory allocation, garbage collection, and other low-level tasks necessary for executing Java programs.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qno3.->  How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?



  The JVM allocates memory in different areas for managing a Java program. The main memory areas are:

Heap Memory: It stores objects and dynamically grows and shrinks as objects are created and garbage collected. It is divided into the Young Generation and the Old Generation.

 1 -> Method Area: It stores class-level information like method bytecode, field and method data, and constant pool. It is shared among all threads.

 2 ->Java Stack: Each thread has its own stack, which tracks method calls and holds local variables and method parameters.

 3 ->Native Method Stack: It supports the execution of native (non-Java) code and is separate from the Java stack.

 4 ->PC Register: It keeps track of the next instruction to be executed within each thread.

 5  ->Runtime Constant Pool: It stores constants, symbolic references, and static information per class.

These memory areas serve different purposes in managing program execution and data storage within the JVM.

 question no 4--> .  What is JIT compiler?


Answer-->4  JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is a component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that dynamically translates
          and optimizes bytecode into machine code at runtime. It improves performance by compiling frequently executed code 
        segments and applying runtime-specific optimizations. The JIT compiler bridges the gap between interpretation and direct
         compilation, allowing for faster execution of Java programs.

question no 5--> What are the various access specifiers in Java?

                


  Answer -->5   
       in Java, access specifiers are keywords used to define the accessibility or visibility of classes, methods, variables, and                      constructors within a program. There are four access specifiers in Java:

1 .public:

  The public access specifier provides the highest level of accessibility.
   Public members can be accessed from anywhere, both within and outside the class, and by other classes.
protected:

 2. The protected access specifier allows access within the same package and subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Protected members are not accessible to unrelated classes outside the package.
default (no keyword):

3 .The default access specifier, also known as package-private, is used when no access specifier is explicitly specified.
Default members are accessible within the same package but not from outside the package.
private:

 4. The private access specifier provides the most restrictive level of accessibility.
Private members are accessible only within the same class and not from any other class or package.

      question no 6--> .What is a compiler in Java?


  Answer no 6-->   In Java, a compiler is a tool that translates source code written in the Java programming 
    language into bytecode. It checks the code for errors, performs analysis and translation, and generates bytecode files.
    These bytecode files can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The compiler ensures that the code follows 
       the rules and grammar of Java and prepares it for platform-independent execution.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
question no 7-->  Explain the types of variables in Java?
   
 
Answer--->  In Java, there are three types of variables: local variables, instance variables, and class variables.

Local Variables:

Declared within a method, constructor, or block.
Accessible only within the scope where they are declared.
Must be initialized before use.
No default values; need explicit assignment.


Instance Variables (Member Variables):

Declared within a class but outside methods, constructors, or blocks.
Associated with instances or objects of the class.
Each instance has its own copy of instance variables.
Initialized to default values if not explicitly assigned.


   Class Variables (Static Variables):

Declared with the "static" keyword within a class.
Associated with the class itself, not instances.
Shared among all instances of the class.
Accessed using the class name, can be modified without instance creation.
Initialized to default values if not explicitly assigned.


Local variables have the highest precedence, followed by instance variables, and then class variables. Understanding these variable types is essential for organizing and managing data in Java programs.

  question no 8-----> .What are the Datatypes in Java?
    


   Data types in programming define the type or kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. They specify the size, range,       and behavior of variables or data objects. Different programming languages have their own set of data types, but here are some common data types:

Integer: Used for whole numbers without decimal points.

Example: int, long, short, byte
Floating-Point: Used for numbers with decimal points.

Example: float, double
Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.

Example: boolean
Character: Represents a single character.

Example: char
String: Represents a sequence of characters.

Example: String
Array: Represents a collection of elements of the same data

question no 9--->  What are the identifiers in java?
   

     In Java, identifiers are names given to elements such as variables, methods, classes, and interfaces. They must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign and can contain letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. Identifiers are case-sensitive, and meaningful names should be used for better readability. Reserved keywords should be avoided as identifiers. Following these rules and conventions helps in writing clean and understandable code in Java.

question no 10---->  The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) architecture consists of three main components: the class loader, runtime data areas, and the execution engine.

Class Loader: Responsible for loading Java class files into the JVM. It locates and loads classes from various sources and resolves dependencies between classes.

Runtime Data Areas: Several runtime data areas store different types of information during program execution.

Method Area:
   Stores class-level data like bytecode, constant pool, and method information.
   Heap: 
Dynamically allocates memory for objects created during program execution.
Java Stack:
 Each thread has its own stack for method calls, local variables, and partial results.


Interpreter: Interprets bytecode line by line and executes the corresponding instructions.
JIT Compiler: Dynamically compiles frequently executed bytecode sections into machine code for improved performance.
